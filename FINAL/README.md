# The Economy of Energy Simulation

This project modelises in a very simplistic way the flow of energy between houses and the market with respect to different factors such as temperature, war, drought or even Elon Musks memes.




## Required Librairies

```bash
  Pyhton3 pip install prompt_toolkit
  Python3 pip install sysv_ipc
  Python3 pip install concurrent.futures
```
    
## Execution

The only program that needs to be executed is the Main.py

```bash
Python3 Main.py
```
To start the simulation, you will have to prompt the number of houses and days you want the simulation to last.
